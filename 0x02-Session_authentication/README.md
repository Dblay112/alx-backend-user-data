Session Authentication in Python
Overview

This project implements session authentication in Python. Session authentication is a common method used by web applications to manage user authentication state. It typically involves creating a unique session identifier (session ID) for each user after successful authentication. This session ID is then used to track the user's authentication state as they navigate the application.

In this project, we'll explore how to implement session authentication using Python and Flask, a lightweight web framework.
